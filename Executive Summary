Executive Summary

This project focuses on using machine learning to detect the risk of heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type.

By leveraging models like Logistic Regression, the system can predict whether a patient is at high or low risk â€” achieving up to 81% accuracy.

The analysis found that age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate are the strongest predictors of heart disease.

This kind of data-driven diagnostic support can help hospitals, insurers, and healthcare startups reduce diagnosis time, prioritize high-risk patients, and enhance preventive care strategies.

In essence, this project demonstrates how data analytics can save lives by combining clinical data analysis with predictive modeling, paving the way for smarter healthcare decisions.
