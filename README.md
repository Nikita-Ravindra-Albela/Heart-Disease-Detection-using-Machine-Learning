# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model that can detect the likelihood of heart disease based on key clinical and lifestyle attributes.
Using data-driven insights, it empowers healthcare professionals to make early and accurate decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

# Objective

To analyze patient data and develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is at risk of heart disease.

# Key Questions Answered

What are the major risk factors contributing to heart disease?

Can we predict heart disease with high accuracy using ML algorithms?

Which variables (cholesterol, age, blood pressure, etc.) influence the prediction most?

How can this model assist healthcare practitioners or preventive health programs?

(Values are examples ‚Äî replace with your actual results)

# Feature Importance

Identified the top 5 factors influencing prediction:

Age

Chest pain type

Cholesterol level

Max heart rate

Exercise-induced angina

# Insights

Patients with higher cholesterol, older age, and exercise-induced angina showed greater heart disease risk.

Chest pain type and maximum heart rate were among the strongest predictors.

The best model achieved ~88% accuracy, suitable for preliminary screening use cases.

# Results Summary

Built a reliable classification pipeline with cross-validation

Reduced false negatives ‚Äî crucial for medical prediction systems

Delivered a visualization-driven report for clinical interpretation

# Future Improvements

Include larger and more diverse datasets for generalization

Implement deep learning (ANN) for non-linear patterns

Deploy on cloud (e.g., AWS / Streamlit web app)

Integrate real-world wearable health data (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
